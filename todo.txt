okay so if we use naive bayse without taking into acount class weights it does 85%
with class_wighing we get 89%

cleaning the data always gives worse results, so maybe just work with that,
we can explain in that when we remove alot of data out model cant make connections so it underfits, this can be shown by 
1)do Naive Bayse without anything
2)show Grapghs about data
3)clean Data
4)run Naive Bayse
5)we get lower f1 
6) we show why the model underfitted
7) we take into acount class wighing and other steps to combat the distribution 21% spam
8)we show that thats better

then show descion tree with adaboost
then show svg maybe experiment with cleanig data?
